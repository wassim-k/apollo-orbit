# Introduction
Codegen is a tool that generates strongly typed code from GraphQL operations (queries/mutations/subscriptions).  
This provides compile time safety for any GraphQL server schema changes, and also enhances the developer experience by offering auto-completion and type checking for GraphQL operations.

## GraphQL Code Generator
**Apollo Orbit** provides its own codegen plugin that's built on top of <Link to="https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen">GraphQL Code Generator</Link>.  
The plugin is designed for an optimal developer experience when working with GraphQL in Angular.  
It is compliant with <Link to="https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node">`TypedDocumentNode`</Link> standard which is supported by most GraphQL clients.

The other plugins used in codegen as per [getting started guide](../../get-started/setup-environment/#setup-apollo-orbitcodegen) are:

* <Link to="https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/plugins/typescript/typescript-operations">typescript-operations</Link>
