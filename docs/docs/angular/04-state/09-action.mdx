import EventCommand from '../../shared/_event-command.mdx';

## Overview
Actions are simple classes that have a unique `type` property and, optionally, additional information.  

Actions generally take one of two forms:
* **Command**: A verb. For example, `[Theme] ToggleTheme`
* **Event**: Past tense. For example, `[Library] BookSelected`

<EventCommand />

## Defining an action
An action is required to have a unique `type`. By convention, `type` follows the format `[<Context>] <ActionName>` to uniquely identify the action throughout the app.

```typescript title="states/theme/theme.actions.ts"
import { ThemeName } from '../../graphql/types';

export class ToggleThemeAction {
    public static readonly type = '[Theme] ToggleTheme';

    public constructor(
        public readonly force?: ThemeName
    ) { }
}
```

## Dispatching an action
Dispatching an action is as simple as calling `actions.dispatch(new ToggleThemeAction())` from anywhere in the app.  

It returns an `Promise<void>` which resolves when all states have completed handling the action. If any of the `action` handlers throws an error, then the promise is rejected with an error.  
This can be useful for executing some logic only after an action has completed, especially if some of the handlers are asynchronous. For example:
```typescript
import { ApolloActions } from '@apollo-orbit/angular/state';

export class ThemeComponent {
  private readonly actions = inject(ApolloActions);
  
  protected toggleTheme(force?: ThemeName): void {
    this.actions.dispatch(new ToggleThemeAction(force)).subscribe({
      next: () => console.log('Theme toggle succeeded'),
      error: () => console.error('Theme toggle failed')
    });
  }

  protected dispatchMultipleActions(): void {
    forkJoin([
      this.actions.dispatch(new FirstAction()),
      this.actions.dispatch(new SecondAction()),
    ]).subscribe({
      next: () => console.log('Actions execution succeeded'),
      error: () => console.error('Actions execution failed')
    });
  }
}
```

### API
```typescript
public dispatch<TAction extends ActionInstance>(action: TAction): Promise<void>

type ActionInstance = InstanceType<ActionType<any>>;

interface ActionType<T> {
  type: string;
  new(...args: Array<any>): T;
}
```

## Handling an action
`action` is used in a `state` slice to define an action handler.

An `action` handler can be synchronous or asynchronous and can be used to update the cache, call a service, or perform any other logic.

Action handlers can be chained together to form a sequence of actions that are executed in order, by using the `dispatch` function which is available in the `ActionContext` parameter.

### Usage
Let's look at an example of how a `LogoutUserAction` can be handled asynchronously in the **user** `state` and chained with another action handler.

```typescript title="states/user/user.state.ts"
export const userState = () => {
  const userSessionApi = inject(UserSessionApi);

  return state(descriptor => descriptor
    .action(LogoutUserAction, (action, { dispatch }) => {
      return userSessionApi.endUserSession().pipe(
        mergeMap(() => dispatch(new UserLoggedOutAction()))
      );
    })
    .action(UserLoggedOutAction, (action, { cache }) => {
      cache.writeQuery({ query: CURRENT_USER_QUERY, data: { currentUser: null } });
    })
  );
}
```

When `actions.dispatch(new LogoutUserAction())` is called from a component or a service, it will:
1. First, invoke the `LogoutUserAction` handler.
2. Then, invoke the `UserLoggedOutAction` handler.
3. Finally, resolve the promise returned by `actions.dispatch(new LogoutUserAction())` when both handlers have finished executing.

:::note
It is important to return the await promises or return observables from asynchronous action handlers to ensure that the promise returned by `dispatch` resolves only after the action handler has finished executing.
:::

### API
```typescript
type ActionFn<T> = (action: T, context: ActionContext) => void | Promise<any> | Observable<any>;

interface ActionContext {
  cache: ApolloCache;
  dispatch: <TAction extends Action | ActionInstance>(action: TAction) => Promise<void>;
}
```

In the next page we will see a complete example of how actions and their handlers can be used for managing [local state](../local-state/).

## Actions stream
`ApolloActions` stream emits all dispatched actions at different stages of their lifecycle.

**Apollo Orbit** provides the following (fully typed) **RxJS** operators to filter the actions stream:
* `ofActionDispatched`: When an action is first dispatched.
* `ofActionSuccess`: When execution of all action handlers has completed successfully.
* `ofActionError`: When execution of one or more action handlers has failed.
* `ofActionComplete`: When execution of all action handlers has completed, regardless of success or failure.

All of the operators return an `Observable<Action>` except for `ofActionComplete` which returns `Observable<ActionComplete<Action>>`.

### API
```typescript
interface ActionComplete<TAction = any> {
    action: TAction;
    error?: Error;
    status: 'success' | 'error';
}
```

### Examples
```typescript
this.actions.pipe(
  ofActionDispatched(AddBookAction)
).subscribe({
  next: action => console.log(`Add book '${action.book.id}' dispatched.`)
});

this.actions.pipe(
  ofActionSuccess(AddBookAction)
).subscribe({
  next: action => console.log(`Add book '${action.book.id}' succeeded.`)
});

this.actions.pipe(
  ofActionError(AddBookAction)
).subscribe({
  next: action => console.error(`Add book '${action.book.id}' failed.`)
});

this.actions.pipe(
  ofActionComplete(AddBookAction)
).subscribe({
  next: result => {
    if (!result.error) {
      console.log(`Add book '${result.action.book.id}' succeeded.`);
    } else {
      console.error(`Add book '${result.action.book.id}' failed. Error: ${result.error.message}`);
    }
  }
});

this.actions.pipe(
  ofActionSuccess(BookSelectedAction, BookDeselectedAction)
).subscribe(action => {
  if (action instanceof BookSelectedAction) {
    console.log(`Book '${action.selectedId}' was selected`);
  } else if (action instanceof BookDeselectedAction) {
    console.log(`Book '${action.deselectedId}' was deselected`);
  }
});
```
> Unsubscribe logic omitted for brevity.

:::tip
Actions stream can also be used for direct communication between components on the page, removing the need for a shared service in some scenarios.
