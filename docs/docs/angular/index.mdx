# Introduction
**Orbit** is a full-featured **<Link to="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</Link>** for **<Link to="https://angular.io/">Angular</Link>**.

**<Link to="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</Link>** is a GraphQL client with advanced caching capabilities which can be used to fetch, cache, and modify application data, all while automatically updating your Angular UI.

**Orbit** brings the power of **Apollo Client** to **Angular** while focusing on developer experience, reliability and performance.

## Why Orbit?

### 🚀 Angular Integration
APIs work naturally with **Angular**'s dependency injection, change detection, and reactive patterns. Supports Angular HTTP interceptors for auth and request handling.

### ⚡ Reactive APIs
Use **Signals** or **RxJS** depending on your needs. Signals fit neatly into components, while RxJS handles complex async flows.

### 🛡️ Type Safety
Fully type-safe with codegen integration—catch schema changes at compile time. Queries, mutations, and subscriptions are strongly typed with IntelliSense support.

### 🎯 Developer Experience
- **Consistent APIs**: Unified, type-safe for queries, mutations, subscriptions, and fragments
- **Docs**: Clear examples and patterns
- **Tooling**: Debug with Apollo Client Devtools

### 💼 Enterprise-Ready
- **Proven**: Battle-tested in production for 5+ years powering critical apps
- **Tree-Shakeable**: Bundle only what you use
- **SSR Support**: Compatible with server-side rendering
- **Multi-Client**: Connect to multiple GraphQL endpoints
- **Testing**: Built-in support for testing with **Apollo Client**'s testing utilities
