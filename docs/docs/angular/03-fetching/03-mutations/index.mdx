# Mutations

This section assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL mutations. If you need a refresher, we recommend <Link to="http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations">this guide</Link>.

This section also assumes that you've already set up your environment as per [getting started guide](../../get-started/setup-environment/).

For a full documentation of mutations, please refer to the <Link to="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/">Apollo Client docs</Link>
