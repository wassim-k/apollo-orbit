First, we'll create a GraphQL query named `Books`:

```graphql title="library/gql/book.graphql"
fragment BookFragment on Book {
  id
  name
  genre
  authorId
}

query Books($name: String, $genre: String, $authorId: ID) {
  books(name: $name, genre: $genre, authorId: $authorId) {
    ...BookFragment
  }
}
```

Saving *book.graphql* will trigger codegen of `BOOKS_QUERY` typed gql document in */graphql/types.ts* file as per our setup.

For more information about **codegen** and how it works, please refer to the [Codegen](../../../codegen/intro/) section.

:::tip
It is recommended to define re-usable fragments, like `BookFragment` above, for a couple of reasons:
* Codegen will generate a `BookFragment` type which can be consistently referenced throughout the codebase.
* Using the same fragment in **queries** and **mutations** ensures that **Apollo Client** can normalize data in cache correctly. For example, if an `updateBook` **mutation** returns a `BookFragment` then our `watchQuery` observable will automatically emit the new value when the **mutation** executes successfully.
