```typescript
Apollo.subscribe<TData, TVariables>(
  options: SubscriptionOptions<TVariables, TData>
): Observable<SubscriptionResult<TData>>
```
Returns a `SubscriptionResult<TData, TVariables>` observable. This observable is long lasting and continues to deliver results from GraphQL backend until unsubscribed from.

## Executing a subscription
To execute a subscription, inject `Apollo` and pass it a GraphQL subscription document.

Let's look at an example.

First, we'll create a GraphQL subscription named `NewAuthor`:

```graphql title="library/gql/author.graphql"
fragment AuthorFragment on Author {
  id
  name
  age
}

subscription NewAuthor {
  newAuthor {
    ...AuthorFragment
  }
}
```

Saving *author.graphql* will trigger codegen of `NEW_AUTHOR_SUBSCRIPTION` typed gql document in */graphql/types.ts* file as per our setup.

For more information about **codegen** and how it works, please refer to the [Codegen](../../../codegen/intro/) section.

Next, we define the subscription in our component:
```typescript title="authors/authors.component.ts"
import { Apollo, mapSubscription } from '@apollo-orbit/angular';
import { NewAuthorSubscription } from '../graphql/types';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-authors',
  templateUrl: './authors.component.html'
})
export class AuthorsComponent {
  private readonly apollo = inject(Apollo);
  
  protected readonly newAuthorName$: Observable<string> = this.apollo.subscribe({ subscription: NEW_AUTHOR_SUBSCRIPTION }).pipe(
    mapSubscription(data => data.newAuthor.name)
  );
}
```
Then, we subscribe to the data using `async` pipe:
```html title="authors/authors.component.html"
@if (newAuthorName$ | async; as newAuthorName) {
  <div class="alert-info">New author was added: {{ newAuthorName }}</div>
}
```

## `mapSubscription`
**Orbit** provides a `mapSubscription` RxJS operator to map `data` of a subscription result while preserving the other properties.  
This is useful when you want to map the subscription result without dealing with the nullability of `data` property.
```typescript
import { mapSubscription } from '@apollo-orbit/angular';
...
protected readonly newAuthorName$: Observable<string> = this.apollo.subscribe({ subscription: NEW_AUTHOR_SUBSCRIPTION }).pipe(
  // code-add-line
  mapSubscription(data => data.newAuthor.name)
);
```
