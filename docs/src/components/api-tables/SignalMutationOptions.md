| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `optimisticResponse?` | `Unmasked<NoInfer<TData>> \| ((vars: TVariables, { IGNORE }: { IGNORE: IgnoreModifier }) => Unmasked<NoInfer<TData>> \| IgnoreModifier)` | By providing either an object or a callback function that, when invoked after<br />a mutation, allows you to return optimistic data and optionally skip updates<br />via the `IGNORE` sentinel object, Apollo Client caches this temporary<br />(and potentially incorrect) response until the mutation completes, enabling<br />more responsive UI updates.<br /><br />For more information, see [Optimistic mutation results](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/optimistic-ui/). |
| `updateQueries?` | `MutationQueryReducersMap<TData>` | A `MutationQueryReducersMap`, which is map from query names to<br />mutation query reducers. Briefly, this map defines how to incorporate the<br />results of the mutation into the results of queries that are currently<br />being watched by your application. |
| `refetchQueries?` | `((result: NormalizedExecutionResult<Unmasked<TData>>) => InternalRefetchQueriesInclude) \| InternalRefetchQueriesInclude` | An array (or a function that _returns_ an array) that specifies which queries you want to refetch after the mutation occurs.<br /><br />Each array value can be either:<br /><br />- An object containing the `query` to execute, along with any `variables`<br /><br />- A string indicating the operation name of the query to refetch |
| `awaitRefetchQueries?` | `boolean` | If `true`, makes sure all queries included in `refetchQueries` are completed before the mutation is considered complete.<br /><br />The default value is `false` (queries are refetched asynchronously). |
| `update?` | `MutationUpdaterFunction<TData, TVariables, TCache>` | A function used to update the Apollo Client cache after the mutation completes.<br /><br />For more information, see [Updating the cache after a mutation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations#updating-the-cache-after-a-mutation). |
| `onQueryUpdated?` | `OnQueryUpdated<any>` | Optional callback for intercepting queries whose cache data has been updated by the mutation, as well as any queries specified in the `refetchQueries: [...]` list passed to `client.mutate`.<br /><br />Returning a `Promise` from `onQueryUpdated` will cause the final mutation `Promise` to await the returned `Promise`. Returning `false` causes the query to be ignored. |
| `errorPolicy?` | `ErrorPolicy` | Specifies how the mutation handles a response that returns both GraphQL errors and partial results.<br /><br />For details, see [GraphQL error policies](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/error-handling/#graphql-error-policies).<br /><br />The default value is `none`, meaning that the mutation result includes error details but _not_ partial results. |
| `context?` | `DefaultContext` | If you're using [Apollo Link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/introduction/), this object is the initial value of the `context` object that's passed along your link chain. |
| `fetchPolicy?` | `MutationFetchPolicy` | Provide `no-cache` if the mutation's result should _not_ be written to the Apollo Client cache.<br /><br />The default value is `network-only` (which means the result _is_ written to the cache).<br /><br />Unlike queries, mutations _do not_ support [fetch policies](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy) besides `network-only` and `no-cache`. |
| `keepRootFields?` | `boolean` | To avoid retaining sensitive information from mutation root field<br />arguments, Apollo Client v3.4+ automatically clears any `ROOT_MUTATION`<br />fields from the cache after each mutation finishes. If you need this<br />information to remain in the cache, you can prevent the removal by passing<br />`keepRootFields: true` to the mutation. `ROOT_MUTATION` result data are<br />also passed to the mutation `update` function, so we recommend obtaining<br />the results that way, rather than using this option, if possible. |
| `onData?` | `(data: TData, options: MutationOptions<TData, TVariables>) => void` | Callback executed when the mutation completes successfully. |
| `onError?` | `(error: ErrorLike, options: MutationOptions<TData, TVariables>) => void` | Callback executed when the mutation encounters an error. |
